# Computer Vision RPS
Include here a brief description of the project, what technologies are used etc.

Milestone 1
In this milestone I have used the Teachable Machine tool to create frames of picture for rock, paper and sissors. This tool allows machine learning, so that when playing the game, it will recoginse what is rock, paper or sissors. Also it can recognise when there is nothing. The more picture frames showing different angles, the better the machine will be able to recognise them. To use this, i firsty created a new image project and made 4 classes within. names of each of the classes: Rock; Paper; Sissors; Nothing. I then made a video by holding the recording button of me showing each of these. In the nothing class, i made a video of a blank screen. The nothing will be helpful later as the computer will recognise it as no input and then can respond by asking for a response. After creating videos of all 4, then clicked the button to train the model which took a few minutes. Once the model was trained, i was able to test it works correctly by showing each type and check if its giving the correct response, which it was. I was then able to download it and add the files to this folder to continue with the project. 

Example: The FastAPI framework allows for fast and easy construction of APIs and is combined with pydantic, which is used to assert the data types of all incoming data to allow for easier processing later on. The server is ran locally using uvicorn, a library for ASGI server implementation.

"""Insert your code here"""
Insert an image/screenshot of what you have built so far here.

Milestone 2
Does what you have built in this milestone connect to the previous one? If so explain how. What technologies are used? Why have you used them? Have you run any commands in the terminal? If so insert them using backticks (To get syntax highlighting for code snippets add the language after the first backticks).

Example below:

/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181
The above command is used to check whether the topic has been created successfully, once confirmed the API script is edited to send data to the created kafka topic. The docker container has an attached volume which allows editing of files to persist on the container. The result of this is below:
"""Insert your code here"""
Insert screenshot of what you have built working.

Milestone n
Continue this process for every milestone, making sure to display clear understanding of each task and the concepts behind them as well as understanding of the technologies used.

Also don't forget to include code snippets and screenshots of the system you are building, it gives proof as well as it being an easy way to evidence your experience!

Conclusions
Maybe write a conclusion to the project, what you understood about it and also how you would improve it or take it further.

Read through your documentation, do you understand everything you've written? Is everything clear and cohesive?
